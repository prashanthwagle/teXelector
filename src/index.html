      CSS Pseudo Selectors: What are they? Prashanth Wagle Prashanth Wagle Nov

      from Pexels Basics Selectors are patterns used to identify select the
      elements in the DOM for which styles would be applied. In fact, they are
      the first part of any CSS rule. Example: h1{ background-color: magenta; }
      h1 is the selector in the above example. Out of various patterns used to
      select a particular DOM element from the tree, pseudo-elements and
      pseudo-classes (obviously!) are one of its kind which is drastically
      different than the common ones. (FYI: Type, class, and ID selectors,
      Attribute selectors, Attribute selectors are the other types).
      Pseudo-Classes Pseudo-classes are identified with a single colon according
      to the CSS3 specification. A pseudo-class is a selector that selects
      elements that are in a specific state. For instance, the specific state
      may be an HTML element that is clicked/hovered or an element that is the
      first child of its parent. The syntax of pseudo-classes is: element:name{
      //properties } Example: li:first-child{ color: red; } Here the first-child
      selector selects the li element which is the first child among its
      siblings. This selector would be helpful in styling without having to
      add/delete classes via Javascript if more sibling elements are added.
      Pseudo-classes which are user-action based The styling will be based on
      the action carried out by the users. Eg: :hover - applies when the user
      hovers over the element, :focus - applies when the user selects the input
      element. Pseudo-Classes which are based on the position The styling will
      be based on the position of the element in the DOM tree relative to its
      sibling/parents. Eg: :first-child – selects the first element within a
      parent. :nth-child() – selects elements based on a simple provided
      algebraic expression. A few instances are :nth-child(2n) wherein all even
      children are selected and :nth-child(2n+1) wherein all odd children are
      selected. Other Pseudo-Classes :not() – removes elements from an existing
      matched set that match the selector inside the parameter of :not(). :empty
      - selects the pseudo-classes which have no text or child elements.
      Pseudo-Elements Pseudo-Elements are used to style specific parts of the
      element or elements. According to the CSS3 specification they are
      identified with double-colon (::). For example, they may be used to change
      the properties of the first letter or a line of an element. The syntax of
      pseudo-elements is: element::name{ //properties } Example: p::first-line {
      color: #5e5e5e; } Examples of Psuedo-Elements The commonly used
      pseudo-elements include: ::first-line to style the first line of the
      element. ::first-letter to style the first letter of the element. ::before
      to insert some content before the element. ::after to insert some content
      after the element. ::selection to style the content selected by the user.
      Other rarely used pseudo-elements: ::file-selector-button, ::backdrop,
      ::cue, ::cue-region, ::grammar-error, ::part(), ::placeholderetc. Note The
      single-colon syntax was used for both pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements
      in CSS2 and CSS1. The double-colon replaced the single-colon notation for
      pseudo-elements in CSS3. This was an attempt from W3C to distinguish
      between pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements. For backward compatibility,
      the single-colon syntax is acceptable for CSS2 and CSS1 pseudo-elements.
